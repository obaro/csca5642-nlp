## Introduction
For this mini project, we're going to attempt the Kaggle 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets' competition.
This is a competition for building a machine learning model that predicts which tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren't.

This competition is currently running indefintely, as of today,and is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).

For this project, we'll be utilizing a RNN Architecture and working to build a model that can detect which tweets are of real disasters and which aren't.

We ran this on Google Colab, and fetched the dataset directly from kaggle.

To fetch the dataset, you will need to get a kaggle API key.
